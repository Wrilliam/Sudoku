# Sudoku
My very first big project: a Sudoku game in Java.

This game was created in 2012, as part of my Programming Techniques for
Engineering course led by late teacher Alexandre Moreira de Moraes. It was
initially planned as a 9x9 board with randomly generated numbers which are
allocated in randomly selected spaces, all while following the game rules.
However, it proved to be too ambitious, so the plan had to be changed to a 6x6
board with randomly generated numbers allocated in sequential spaces, with the
rules being adapted to the board size.

Given the fact I was a rookie when this source code was made, it's pretty basic
in some ways, as it brings some of the most core elements of object-oriented
programming.
