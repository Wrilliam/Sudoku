# Sudoku

My very first big project: a basic, traditional Sudoku game.

This game was created in 2012, as part of my Programming Techniques for
Engineering course led by late teacher Alexandre Moreira de Moraes. It was
initially planned as a 9x9 board with randomly generated numbers which are
allocated in randomly selected spaces, all while following the game rules.
However, it proved to be too much for my hardware to handle, so the plan had
to be changed to a 6x6 board with randomly generated numbers allocated in
sequential spaces, with the rules being adapted to the board size.

Given the fact I was a rookie when this source code was made, it's pretty basic
in some ways, as it brings some of the most core elements of object-oriented
programming.

UPDATE: the project was brought back in December 2020, and its source code was
overhauled in order to correct any errors and warnings, as well as reverting
back to the originally planned 9x9 board while maintaining the sequential
allocation of the randomly generated numbers. It was also exported to a runnable
.jar file, which was made using Java 1.8.
